# Potemkin_Project
Trello project automation using API calls and Python.  Quick setup of pen test activities with links to documentation.

Goal is to provide a cradle-to-the-grave roadmap of how your pen test should run, including documentation for each step of the way.  When actual commands are required they will be provided.
